Let \\(x\\) be the observed frequency of experimental subjects exhibiting the trait of interest. 5.0.3 Hypotheses The hypotheses for the Binomial test may take the following forms: For a two-sided test: \\[\\begin{align} H_0: p = \\pi \\\\ H_a: p \\neq \\pi \\end{align}\\] For a one-sided test: \\[\\begin{align} H_0: p &lt; \\pi \\\\ H_a: p \\geq \\pi \\end{align}\\] or \\[\\begin{align} H_0: p &gt; \\pi \\\\ H_a: p \\leq \\pi \\end{align}\\] 5.0.4 Decision Rule The decision to reject the null hypothesis is made when the observed value of \\(x\\) lies in the critical region that suggests the probability of that observation is low. We define the critical region as the upper bound we are willing to accept for \\(\\alpha\\), the Type I Error. In a two-sided test, the upper bound is shared equally in both tails. Due to the discrete nature of the distribution, the total probability in the tails may not equal \\(\\alpha\\). The figures below depict examples of rejection regions for selected values of the Binomial distribution parameters. The decision rule is: Reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(x &lt; Binomial(\\alpha/2, n, \\pi)\\) or \\(x &gt; Binomial(1 - \\alpha/2, n, \\pi)\\) "]
