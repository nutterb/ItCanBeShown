# Rounding

## Floor (Next Lowest Integer)

Rounding to the next lower integer, denoted $\floor{x}$, is defined as

$$\floor{x} = max{m \in \mathbb{Z} | m \leq x}$$

## Ceiling

Rounding to the next larger integer, denoted $\ceiling{x}$, is defined as

$$\ceiling{x} = min{m \in \mathbb{Z} | m \geq z}$$

## Nearest Integer

Rounding to the nearest integer is a common operation without a notation with well established concensus.  It may be represented as $\lbrack x \rbrack$, $\lfloor x \rceil$, $||x||$, $nint(x)$ or $round(x)$.  Here, we will use the $round(x)$ notation so that we may have communicative notation to extending rounding beyond integers.

**A mathematical representation of rounding would be really nice to have right here**

## Nearest Multiple

Rounding to a nearest multiple may be obtained through a rescaling of the value $x$ into a integer scale based on multiples of $m$. One available notation for this operation is $mround(x, m)$.

$$mround(x, m) = round(\frac{x}{m}) \cdot m$$

## Nearest Place (Base 10)

It is common in mathematical operations to round a value not to an integer, but to a decimal place.  This is no different than rounding to a multiple of ten.  We define the following conventions.

* Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$
* Let $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ where $p$ represents the negative power of ten of the desired precision of the result. 

Thus, when $p = 0$, we with to round to the $10 ^ {-0} = 10^0 = 1$, or ones/integer position.  When $p = 1$, we round to the $10 ^ {-1} = \frac{1 / 10} = 0.01$, or tenths position.  And when $p = -1$, we round to the $10 ^ 1 = 10$, or tens position.

We define the operation $round(x, p)$ to be the operation of rounding to the nearest decimal place.

$$\begin{aligned}
round(x, p) &= mround(x, 10 ^ {-p}) \\
  &= round(\frac{x}{10 ^ {-p}}, 0) \cdot 10 ^ {-p} \\
  &= \frac{round(x \cdot 10 ^ p, 0)}{10 ^ p}
\end{aligned}$$
