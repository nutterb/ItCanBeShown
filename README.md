# It Can Be Shown

There is one phrase that makes me cringe every time I see it. It’s a phrase that embodies feelings of frustration, inadequacy, and failure to understand. That phrase:

> It can be shown

Everytime I read that phrase, I would look at the subsequent result and think “Really? It can?”

_It Can Be Shown_ is a collection of notes that I’ve put together to avoid having to feel that way in the future. It is, essentially, a collection of definitions and proofs that have helped me understand and apply mathematical and statistical theory. Most imporantly, it spells even the smallest steps along each development so that I don’t have to worry about solving it again in the future.

This repository is the source for the markdown code that creates the webpage content.  The book is accessible at http://nutterb.github.io/ItCanBeShown/.  The main branch for the code is `gh-pages`, with development ongoing in the `gh-pages-devel` branch.
